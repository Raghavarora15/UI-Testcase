**Project Setup and Test Execution Guide**

This guide will walk you through the setup process for running test cases for the "goodreads.com" website using Selenium WebDriver, Mocha, and Chai.

**Step 1: Install Node and npm**

Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Check if Node.js is installed:
   ```
   node --version
   ```

2. Check if npm is installed:
   ```
   npm --version
   ```

If Node.js and npm are not installed, download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

**Step 2: Create Project Folder**

Create a folder on your local machine to set up the project.

**Step 3: Open the Project Folder in Your IDE**

Open the project folder in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work on the project.

**Step 4: Clone and Initialize the Project**

1. Clone the project from GitHub using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <project_url>
   ```

2. Initialize the Git repository in the project folder:
   ```
   git init
   ```

**Step 5: Install Dependencies**

In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

1. Install Mocha:
   ```
   npm install mocha
   ```

2. Install Selenium WebDriver:
   ```
   npm install selenium-webdriver
   ```

3. Install Chai (for assertions):
   ```
   npm install chai
   ```

**Step 6: Configure Test Scripts**

Open the `package.json` file in the project folder and modify the "scripts" section as follows:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "mocha --no-timeouts"
},
```

**Step 7: Run the Test Cases**

To run the test cases, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
npx mocha --no-timeouts
```

The tests will be executed, and you will see the results in the terminal.

**Note:** Before running the tests, make sure you have set up the Selenium WebDriver and the necessary browser drivers properly.
